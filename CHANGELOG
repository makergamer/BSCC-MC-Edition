CHANGELOG

- changed tests from '[' to '[['.
  '[' is a user-space binary just like the 'test' command.
  '[[' is internal to bash and saves a smidge of time & effort

- cleaned up indention. added some external blank lines to easy reading

- 'case' matching do not require open parentheses, just quoting to stringify. 

- fixed some typos
